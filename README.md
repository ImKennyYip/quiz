In this tutorial, we go over how to create a quiz app in javascript html and css. This tutorial will cover how to randomly select a question to populate onto the web page, process button clicks to answer questions, and update the page to inform the user if the answer was correct or not.

## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. One feature you can implement is letting the user know the correct answer via highlighting the button (changing background color) with the correct answer or simply displaying it as text below the buttons. Another option is score keeping by keeping track of the number of correct answers over total number of questions asked. You can also add a timer to make the quiz more difficult so that users must answer the question within a few seconds, otherwise it will be marked as incorrect.
